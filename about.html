<p> About half 6 months ago, I wrote an article in MITâ€™s newspaper, The Tech, where I confessed about my
experience of missing lectures due to the lack of menstrual products in school
buildings. My article received an overwhelming amount of attention and support on
social media as a lot of my MIT peers resonated with my experience. Since then, I've spoken with student leaders from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Wellesley, etc to gain their insights on making free menstrual products a reality on campus.
I've been working closely with various student organizations and having sustained dialogues with MIT offices on this subject.</p>

<p> I hope to jumpstart further progress through the "Menstrual Insurance" project. As an MIT beaver, I believe that formulating a problem is a good start,
but I need to put in concrete action to solving the problem. So this weakly artistic craft project is my approach of making free menstrual products more accessible on campus.
I even learned to make a website because that's tech is cool or something. </p>

<p> My vision is for MIT to be the pioneering institution in promoting equity in
education, by expanding the MindHandHeart pilot in Spring
2020 as a starting point, and progressing towards free menstrual products permanently in all
bathrooms. I believe that menstrual products should be in bathrooms like other staples such as
toilet paper and soap. I believe that every MIT person who menstruates should have
access to menstrual products wherever and whenever they might need them. I believe
that providing these products for free and across various locations on campus
promotes equality in education and scientific research. I believe that MIT cares about
the physical and mental wellness of its students. I believe that MIT can be a leader in
this global movement that advocates for basic rights and dignity. </p>
